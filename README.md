# monty_hall_paradox_simulator
Simulating one of my favorite mathematical paradoxes. 

The Monty Hall problem is a mind blowing paradox that fooled many smart people, including the great mathematician,
Paul Erd≈ës. According to an anecdote, he was not convinced dispite of mathematical proofs given until a computer
simulation was showed to him. As I'm fairly new to programming, I decided to give the simulation a try using Python.

The problem:
There are 3 closed doors. One of them holds a valuable prize, the other two don't. The player picks one.
Then the we open one of the other two doors that surely isn't a winner. Then the player can choose to keep her original
pick or she can swap with the other closed door.
Is it worth to swap?

The intuition:
There's no point swapping as there are two doors, so the chances are 50/50% for each.

The reality:
The choosen door has 1/3 of a chance to be the winner while the other two have 2/3 of a chance COMBINED.
Therefore, if we open one of the non chosen doors the other one will still have 2/3 of a chance,
hence it's twice as likely to be the winner as the originally picked one. 

The sad truth:
Like all probabilistic problems work only on large sample sizes. Even if you swap, you still have only a
~66.6% chance of winning. Which is still quite slim. 

Also note:
The problem was named after American TV host Monty Python whose show (Let's Make a Deal) had a *similar* setup.
The winning door held a car, the two others a goat each. The reason why I don't follow the usual naming convention
(i.e. car, goat) and use winner/loser dichotomy instead is not only because the show's selection part was a bit
different from the (in)famous Monty Hall Paradox.
I did so mostly because I would't give a f.ck about the car if I could have a cute goat instead.
